	<p>As a small and independent non-profit organisation, we've been maintaining the world's largest open dataset on verified green hosting providers, <strong>the Green Domains dataset</strong>, since 2012. Every day, across the globe, aroundÂ seven million checks against it are made using our <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/api/greencheck/v3/check-single-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Web Check API</a> and <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Web Check</a> tools.<p>
	
	<h2 class="text-2xl">How can my organisation be included in the dataset?</h2>
	<p>Hosting providers can submit a free verification request to us to <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/what-you-need-to-register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonstrate they are green</a>. All verified hosting providers are included in the Green Domains dataset for free.</p>
	<p>Once verified, hosting providers can further support our mission to green the internet by 2030, by paying a modest fee to be included in our <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Hosting Directory</a>.</p>
	<p>Whichever route you choose, the starting point is the same - use our verification request form.
