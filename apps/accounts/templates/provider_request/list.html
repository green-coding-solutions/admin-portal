		<h1>The Green Domains dataset</h1>
		<p>As a small and independent non-profit organisation, we've been maintaining the world's largest open dataset on green hosting providers, <strong>the Green Domains dataset</strong>, since 2012. Every day, across the globe, aroundÂ seven million checks against it are made using our <a href="https://developers.thegreenwebfoundation.org/api/greencheck/v3/check-single-domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Web Check API</a> and <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/green-web-check/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Web Check</a> tools.<p>

			<h3 class="text-2xl border-b-2">How can my organisation be included in the dataset?</h3>
			<p>Hosting providers can submit a verification request to us to <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/what-you-need-to-register/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demonstrate they are green</a>. This process is free of charge.</p>
			<p>Once verified, hosting providers are included in the Green Domains dataset by default and for free.</p>
			<p>Verified hosting providers can choose to further support our work by paying a modest fee to be included in our <a href="https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Green Hosting Directory</a> service.</p>
			<p>Whether you want to be included in just the dataset or the directory as well, the starting point is the same - submit a verification request.</p>
